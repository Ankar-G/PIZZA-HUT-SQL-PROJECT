# PIZZA-HUT-SQL-PROJECT
üçï Pizza Hut Sales Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project
This project is a SQL-based analysis of Pizza Hut sales and customer data. The goal was to explore business insights such as top-selling pizza types, customer ordering patterns, peak order times, and overall sales trends.

Using SQL, I performed data cleaning, created custom queries, and analyzed different aspects of the dataset to answer key business questions. This helped in identifying high-performing menu items, understanding customer preferences, and uncovering opportunities for improving sales strategies.

The project demonstrates my ability to:

Write efficient SQL queries

Clean and manipulate raw data

Use SQL functions to extract meaningful insights

Think analytically like a data-driven decision maker
